# openoutreach/emails/tasks/send.py
"""EMAIL task — sends the single Layer-1 email for a deal at READY_TO_EMAIL.

Layer 1 is outbound-only and single-shot: the daemon sends one email per
email-reachable lead and never re-emails (follow-ups + replies are the hosted
Layer-2 backend's job, reconstructed straight from the mailbox). So the whole
task is: pick the oldest queued deal + an under-cap box, let the agent compose,
send over SMTP, and record the send on the Deal — which moves it to EMAILED.

Each concern lives where it's cohesive; this module is just the orchestration:
  - the queue (one FSM state)  → ``core.db.deals.get_emailable_deals``
  - the per-box daily cap       → ``emails.models.Mailbox`` pacing manager
  - SMTP transport              → ``emails.sender.send_email``
